This case study is an analysis of the house sale price in Ames, Iowa spanning from January 2006 to mid-2010, answering 4 questions.

(1) The first question is mainly data cleaning to target the right statistics of the dataset.

(2) The second involves: 
               2.1) Data Pre-processing - Checking Missing Values 
                                          and Outliers (Interquartile Range, KMeans, Isolation Forests, OneClassSVM)
               2.2) Time Series Analysis - Seasonal Decomposition
                                           Tests for Stationarity
                                           Time Series Modeling (Moving Average, Simple Exponential Smoothing, Holt's Linear Smoothing,                                                                    Seasonal Auto-ARIMA)
               2.3) Charts for Visualization
              
(3) The third includes Data Pre-processing; 
                       Statistical Modeling (logistic Regression, LASSO Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression);
                       Data Visualization.
                       
(4) The last question calculates net present values for different options regarding how to suggest the client (house owner) to maximize revenue in the house sale market.
